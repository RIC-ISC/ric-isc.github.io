On Wednesday, October 21st the RIC Information Security Club will be holding an event to challange the [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). This is a great way to get some experience interacting with the linux command line and see a few basic ways these systems can be attacked. We'll walk through the wargame levels together and see how far we can get!

No prior experience with linux is required, all you'll need to participate is an SSH client like [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). If you don't feel like doing the levels but still want to watch we'll be doing a screen share so everyone can follow along with each solution.

All RIC students are welcome to join the meeting! If you know anyone who might be interested in tagging along please feel free to share the event with them.

The event will be held on Zoom at 1pm Oct 21st. The link to join will be posted on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/N63yqY2) a day in advance so feel free to come and check it out!
