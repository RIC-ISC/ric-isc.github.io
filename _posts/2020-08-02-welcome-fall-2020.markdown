The RIC Information Security Club is looking forward to welcoming incoming students and new members for the Fall 2020 semester!

This is obviously a challenging time for everyone but our club is going to make an effort to host events and content throughout the semester. We'll be looking at ways to do online events and meetings that everyone can participate in. Keep your eye on our website or follow us on social media to learn about how to join upcoming events.
